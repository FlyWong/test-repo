           Our online tutors conduct lessons without the physical constraints of traditional tuition classes. They are thus able to have adhoc lessons with students when students need them (eg. if student has problem revising for tomorrow's test, he can request an adhoc session that evening) and provide students more flexibility in timing of lessons without worrying about the inconvenience of travel.

           <p>
               As a result, students can truly learn <strong>Anywhere</strong>, <strong>Anytime</strong> so long as they have laptops / smart devices and internet connection.<p>
               Look through our tutors&#39; information, read their students&#39; testimonials and review their free materials (if any) before selecting the most suited tutor. <br />
           <br />
           Like traditional tuition, our online lessons are conducted in <strong>real-time</strong>. Students can<br />
           <br />

           <ul>
               <li>Interact freely with tutors via voice, text or the whiteboard</li>
               <li>See tutors writing/drawing on whiteboard</li>
               <li>See tutors' expressions and body language</li>

           </ul>

           Our tutors can provide a greater degree of supervision to students.

       <p>Conventional tutors typically only see their students once a week. As a result, they could only check students' progress and do the necessary intervention on a weekly basis.<br />
       <br />
    

   
       At Tuition@Ease, our tutors have the freedom to schedule mid week lesson to check on student&#39;s intermediate progress if necessary. Thus, learning or discpline issues can be handled in a more timely manner. For students who need close supervision, this will be very helpful.&nbsp;

           Technology is an integral part of Singapore’s education system.
           
           <br />
           <br />
           Entering the Mobile Age, technology is slowly but surely transforming the Singapore’s private education.
           <br />
           <br />
           <strong>Free</strong> learning sites like Khan Academy and, more relevant to Singapore’s GCE syllabus, <strong>Open Lecture</strong>, have allowed students to learn any topic, anywhere and anytime as long as they have a laptop / smart device and internet connection.
           &nbsp;<br />
           <br />
           Students can have their questions clarified with <strong>EduSnap</strong>, the mobile app that enables students to upload their questions for volunteer tutors to solve for <strong>Free</strong>! 
           <br />

           Good tuition though, is more than delivering content and providing solutions.<br />
           <br />
           A good tutor gets to <strong>know</strong> his students, <strong>ensures</strong> proper understanding and <strong>motivates</strong> his students to do better. These are the <strong>Human factors</strong> which cannot be replaced.<br />
           <br />
           In Tuition@Ease, our ‘live’ online lessons deliver <strong>quality teaching</strong> from <strong>good tutors</strong> with the convenience empowered by technology.<br />
           <br />
           Imagine the time and effort saved when students do not need to travel to and fro tuition centres.<br />
           <br />
           Imagine how encouraged a student can be when his tutor can revise tips, reassure his key concepts are correct and wish him good luck for next morning’s test/exam the night before, at 9:30pm. The student will go to bed with confidence bolstered.<br />
           <br />
           So come join us and realize the benefits that students could previously only imagine.</p>
